Personal HW. Dijkstra's algoritm with Fibonacci Heap and comparison with Priority Queue.

Version 4.0.

Fibonacci Heap works with simple and advanced tests, compared with Priority Queue.
Dijkstra's algoritm works with simple test both with Fibonacci Heap and Priority Queue,
Fibonacci Heap and Priority Queue based versions compared with advanced tests.

Makefile:
"make fib_test" - 'fib_test',  Fibonacci Heap simple and advanced tests, comparisons with Priority Queue.
"make dij_test" - 'dij_test', Dijkstra's algoritm simple test, Fibonacci Heap and Priority Queue compared with advanced tests.
('-std=c++11' included)

'fib_test' results are in 'FibData' folder.
'dij_test' results are in 'DijData' folder.
System information is in 'System' folder.
